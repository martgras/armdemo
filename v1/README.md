# Deploy a Dual Stack MQTT Server in Azure using an ARM template - Version 1
All deployments are done with nested deployments because we either need the the output of a deployment for another deployment or because we update resources in a different resourcegroup

[createresources](https://github.com/martgras/armdemo/blob/653fd7f719e5de4fa900acab05965a867c4d85f5/v1/azuredeploy.json#L66-L622)
this template creates the network resources, storage and the VM.
in outputs the managed identity is returned. createrbac uses the value 

[getpubip](https://github.com/martgras/armdemo/blob/653fd7f719e5de4fa900acab05965a867c4d85f5/v1/azuredeploy.json#L623-L700)
Used by updatedns to retrieve the IP Addresses assigned to the publicIPs.
Currently public IPv6 Addresses only support the Dynamic allocation mode. That means that we get the IP Address after the publicIP resource has been assigned (to a NIC, LBâ€¦) 
Because the LoadBalancer resource needs the publicIP to exists during deployment the public IPs are created before the Loadbalancer. When the deployment is complete all publicIPs are connected to a resource and have a valid IP Address
This show how a nested deployment can be used like a function to return information from a already deployed resource

[updatedns](https://github.com/martgras/armdemo/blob/653fd7f719e5de4fa900acab05965a867c4d85f5/v1/azuredeploy.json#L701-L783)
Creates A and AAA records in the provided DNS Zone.
If you have permissions the DNS Zone can be in a different subscription but in the same tenant. 

[createrbac](https://github.com/martgras/armdemo/blob/653fd7f719e5de4fa900acab05965a867c4d85f5/v1/azuredeploy.json#L784-L834): 
Assigns the network-contributor role to the NSG Firewall Rules
The reason is that the VM only needs to open port 80 while the certificate from Letsencrpyt is requested/renew. Therefore, the VM will open the ports during this process and then close it again 

The order of deployment is 
```
createresources --- getpubip -- updatedns
                +-- createrbac  
```

### 2. Configuring the virtual machine setup
ssh to the VM and follow [How to Install and Secure the Mosquitto MQTT Messaging Broker on Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-the-mosquitto-mqtt-messaging-broker-on-ubuntu-18-04-quickstart) :smile:

A better option is defining the configuation in our ARM template. One possibility is the Custom Script Extension for Linux. 
A more portable and comfortable option is levering cloud-init.
Cloud-init allows you to supply a initial configuation (in Yaml format) that is applied when the VM is first booted. See ...
We are supporting [cloud-init for Azure Linux VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/using-cloud-init). 
You pass the content of the cloud-init file to the customData property in the ARM template. 

Unfortuantly you cannot embedd the content directly. It has to be converted to a one-line string. (Replace all crlf or lf's with \n and esscape any quotes - see)
(BTW: A nice trick is leveraging the #include statement in cloud-config where you can include parts from URL)

See the cloud-init documentation to learn about the configuation settings 
Essentially all updates are installed. The required packages are installed. And files are created on the host: mosquitto config and 2 shellscripts that open/close port 80. 
Then az cli setup is started followed by apt cleanup (remove packages that are not required anymore)
certbot then requests the certificate for this VM from Letsencrypt. After that port 80 on the Azure Firewall is closed.
A cron task to renew the certificat before expiry (60 days) is created automatically.
Finally, the VM reboots if required 
Note $host,$fqdn ,$rg - these placeholder are replaced by the ARM template with the actually values 

See ["[replace(replace(replace('#cloud-config\nhostname: $host\n...','$fqdn',variables('fqdn')),'$rg',variables('rg')),'$host',parameters('vmName'))]"](https://github.com/martgras/armdev/blob/ce2cee59a3261c4899f5ba789de88c08dc325e0c/mqtt/v1/azuredeploy.json#L146)

**Note**

The customer-data value  for cloud-init must be a one liner - which is a pain to work with directly 
Therefore I'm using powershell to convert dualstack.yaml to single line value suited for JSON and copies it to the clipboard

````powershell
Install-Module -Name ClipboardText  ## Powershell has no command for clipboard
$Content = Get-Content -raw -path $cloudinit
$oneline =  $Content.Replace('\','\\').Replace("`r`n","\n").Replace("`n","\n").Replace('"','\"')
Set-ClipboardText $oneline
$oneline

Or all in one line

(Get-Content -raw -path .\dualstack.yaml).replace('\','\\').Replace("`r`n","\n").Replace("`n","\n").Replace('"','\"')  | Set-ClipboardText ; Get-ClipboardText
````


**Don't forget to disable SSH when done (Change NSG rule for SSH to Deny)**



**Side node - Be carefull when updating API Versions - things may break**  
>Even when you set the allocation method to *static*, you cannot specify the actual IP address assigned to the *public IP resource*. Instead, it gets allocated from a pool of available IP addresses in the Azure location the resource is created in.

*Note*:  this template needs a ssh public key. The deployment works with the sample key given here but of course can't be used to sign in because you don't have a private key for it. See [Create and manage SSH keys for authentication to a Linux VM in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/create-ssh-keys-detailed)


### Validate the deployment


#### Watch the cloud-init steps on the Serial Console 
If you open the VM directly after the deployment is completed and select "Serial Console" you can see how the cloud-init script is processed (takes ~5 minutes)


#### Test the DNS records **
````bash
ping -4 mgqtt1.demo.contoso.com
Pinging mgqtt1.demo.contoso.com [52.143.187.46] with 32 bytes of data:

ping -6 mgqtt1.demo.contoso.com
Pinging mgqtt1.demo.contoso.com [2603:1020:800::26] with 32 bytes of data:
````

#### Mqtt setup 

##### Linux

If you are using Linux or WSL  you can use mosquitto_pub and mosquitto_sub 
The --capath parameter is required to tell the mosquitto clients to use TLS for the connection
depending on your distribution the location of the certificate files may vary

Subscribe to the broker 
```sh
  mosquitto_sub -h mgqtt1.demo.contoso.com -t '#' -d -u user1 -P YTQWs9qtPgeTiyDaQLDI --capath /etc/ssl/certs/
```

Publish a message
```sh
mosquitto_pub -h mgqtt1.demo.contoso.com -t 'test' -m "Hi there" -u user1 -P YTQWs9qtPgeTiyDaQLDI --capath /etc/ssl/certs/
```

##### Windows

For Windows MQTT Explorer is a nice tools - you can download the portable (no setup required) version from https://github.com/thomasnordquist/MQTT-Explorer/releases/download/v0.3.5/MQTT-Explorer-0.3.5.exe
You can also download it from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9PP8SFM082WD?ocid=badge)

##### Android / IoS

I am using the MQTT broker with [OwnTracks](https://owntracks.org/booklet/) on my phone to send a message when I'm leaving my house to turn off lights and heating.

There are a couple of MQTT clients in Googles PlayStore or Apples App Store 



## Challenge 
 * Create a keyvault and get the values for adminPassword and adminPublicKey from vault secrets  
   Hint : You only have to modify/use a template paramater file 
*  Configure OwnTracks to send a message when you leave a defined Zone
